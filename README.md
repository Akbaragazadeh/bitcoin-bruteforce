# bitcoin-bruteforce
A Golang program made to generate private keys, public keys, and wallet address checking to attempt to find funds. This is the most recent up to date FREE bruteforcer.

# how to use

./btcbrute threads out-file.txt

# Information

All bitcoin addresses with funds in them will be recorded to the out-file.txt you choose. You can also rename this to anything you want. I advise you to run this in a screen and leave it for running for days on end. This is an efficient method of trying to obtain free funds.

Make sure Golang 1.2.1 is installed or latest version.
